# b9labs_project_splitter

This truffle project deploys a smart contract. \
The contract aims to facilitate splitting a single ether transfer \
in to two equal parts. It keeps balances for recipient addresses \
internally and allows the associated address to withdraw their balances.

It employs SafeMath and Ownable from OpenZeppelin.

The project uses Node.js, truffle, truffle-assertions, truffle-hdwallet-provider, and infura.io.
